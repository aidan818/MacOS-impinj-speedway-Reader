In the ViewController.cs file I try to call a function called UpdateData which will add to the array and update the table. However, I am having trouble getting this function to also be called in my for loop when each tag is detected. This loop is at the bottom of Connection called OnTagsReported. I have commented the errors that I have encountered above the UpdateData function on the viewcontroller file. The issue is that the functions and objects I am trying to call have different requirements.
